# Recovering reduced closed subgroups from geometric points

Let `H` be a commutative Hopf algebra over a field. A Hopf ideal `I` cuts out the subgroup of
geometric points of `H` that vanish on `I`. If the quotient `H/I` is reduced and of finite type,
its points over any algebraically closed extension separate functions, so this subgroup
determines `I`.

The order statement is contravariant: if every point cut out by `J` is also cut out by `I`, then
`I ≤ J`, provided `H/J` is reduced and of finite type. Applying it in both directions shows that
two reduced finite-type closed subgroups with the same points have the same defining Hopf ideal.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.HopfIdeal.le_of_quotientPointsSubgroup_le`: recover an inclusion of Hopf ideals from
  the reverse inclusion of their algebraically closed point subgroups.
* `TauCeti.HopfIdeal.eq_of_quotientPointsSubgroup_eq`: reduced finite-type closed subgroups are
  determined by their algebraically closed points.

## References

* J. S. Milne, *Algebraic Groups* (2017), Sections 1.d and 2.a.
* W. C. Waterhouse, *Introduction to Affine Group Schemes*, Section 3.2.

This is the point-separation input for the maximal-torus step in Layer 7 of the ReductiveGroups
roadmap. It allows pointwise centralizer calculations to determine reduced closed subgroup
schemes.
