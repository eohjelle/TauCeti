#!/usr/bin/env bash
# lint-env.sh — enforce Mathlib's default environment-linter set (`#lint`) plus a
# reliable docstring check, with a grandfathered baseline. This generalizes the former
# lint-simp-nf.sh from `#lint only simpNF` to all default linters (simpNF, checkType,
# synTaut, structureInType, defsWithUnderscore, simpComm, ...).
#
# Why not `lake exe runLinter TauCeti`: the root TauCeti.lean is intentionally empty
# (the lakefile glob is authoritative for what gets built), so runLinter would lint an
# empty environment and pass vacuously. Instead we generate a driver module that
# imports every `TauCeti/**/*.lean` module and runs `#lint only ... in TauCeti`,
# elaborate it against the already-built oleans (`lake env lean`), and parse the
# violations out of the linter report, attributing each one to the linter whose
# section it appears in.
#
# docBlame IS EXCLUDED from the `#lint` pass and replaced by a direct scan — do NOT
# "simplify" this back to the linter. Under the Lean module system the linter
# framework's introspection is systematically wrong across module boundaries:
#   * docstrings are exported only to the `server`/`private` parts of the `.olean`
#     (see `docStringExt` in Lean's `DocString/Extension.lean`: `exported := #[]`),
#     so in the module-style driver `Lean.findDocString?` sees NO docstring for any
#     imported declaration and docBlame flags thousands of documented declarations;
#   * theorems whose proofs live in non-`@[expose]`d oleans are surfaced to it as
#     `axiom`s (docBlame reported ~4.5k phantom "axiom missing documentation string"
#     hits, and misclassified undocumented defs as axioms, on a library with zero
#     real axioms — CI's `lake exe axioms` audit proves that separately).
# `#lint` has no exclusion syntax, so the driver runs `#lint only $LINTERS`, the
# explicit default-set-minus-docBlame list below. Running docBlame and dropping its
# report section instead would open a forgery channel (a crafted declaration name
# containing a newline could print a fake `docBlame` section opener inside the report
# and swallow subsequent real violations); with `only`, docBlame never runs, so any
# docBlame-attributed line is a forgery and fails closed as an unbaselined violation.
# So that new default linters added upstream are not silently missed, the docstring
# scan driver re-derives the default set from the environment and FAILS if it no
# longer equals $LINTERS + docBlame — a Batteries/Mathlib bump that changes the
# default linter set turns into a loud CI failure asking for a human update here.
# The docstring check itself runs as a
# generated LEGACY (non-module) driver with plain imports: with a non-module root,
# Lean imports the whole closure at the `private` olean level, where both docstrings
# and true declaration kinds are visible. Calibration (2026-07, this file's PR):
# module-style probes (`public import` and `import all`) both returned no docstring
# for known-documented declarations, the legacy probe found 671/677 documented,
# flagged a scratch undocumented `def` by name, and did not flag known-documented
# `TauCeti.GridDiagram.OSet`, `TauCeti.Isotopy`,
# `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.WeilDivisor.coeff`. Standing fail-closed guards (each
# with a distinct failure message, so a regression is diagnosable):
#   * the scan echoes every scanned declaration as a `DOCSCAN-ALL <decl> <status>`
#     line (tallies cross-checked against the nonce-protected summary);
#   * the three known-documented sentinel declarations above, spread across the
#     library, must each be scanned AND seen as documented (full blindness sees no
#     docstrings; PARTIAL blindness would silently narrow coverage);
#   * every `docString` baseline entry must still appear among the scanned
#     declarations — no longer VIOLATING is ratchetable, but no longer SCANNED is
#     coverage loss and fails;
#   * a minimum scanned-count floor (500; see the inline comment) catches a
#     collapsed candidate set.
# If docstring storage or the candidate enumeration moves again, these checks FAIL
# rather than reporting hundreds of false violations or silently passing. The scan mirrors
# docBlame's rules (skip auto-generated declarations, instances, `Prop`-valued
# projections; require docstrings on definitions, inductives, opaques, axioms —
# theorems are deliberately exempt, as in Mathlib, where docBlameThm is a separate,
# non-default linter). Its findings are reported under the pseudo-linter name
# `docString`. NOTE: `@[nolint docBlame]` has no effect on the scan (it does not read
# nolint attributes); deliberate exceptions get a `docString <decl>` baseline entry.
#
# Violations that predate this check are grandfathered in scripts/lint-baseline.txt
# (lines of `<linter> <declName>`, LC_ALL=C sorted, no duplicates):
#   - a (linter, declaration) pair NOT in the baseline is a NEW violation  -> exit 1;
#   - a baseline entry that no longer violates is printed as a RATCHET reminder
#     (delete it from the baseline in a follow-up PR), without failing.
# The simpNF entries are the deliberate exception set kept after the 2026-07
# library-wide cleanup (see the wave-2/3 PR bodies, TauCeti #649-#657, #669-#673, for
# per-entry rationale); the rest are grandfathered singletons being fixed in parallel
# PRs.
#
# LINTER FAILED entries: a linter can crash on a declaration instead of judging it
# (its `#check` block then reads `/- LINTER FAILED: ... -/`; e.g. structureInType
# currently crashes on a private structure — another module-system introspection
# artifact). We treat a crash as a violation attributed to that linter, baseline-able
# like any other, so the known artifacts are grandfathered but a linter crashing on
# NEW code fails CI loudly rather than silently skipping the declaration.
#
# `@[nolint <linter>]` ratchet: silencing a linter per-declaration would bypass the
# baseline, so every `@[nolint ...]` application under TauCeti/ must be accounted for
# in scripts/lint-nolints-allowlist.txt as a DECLARATION-LEVEL `<linter> <declName>`
# line (LC_ALL=C sorted, no duplicates — the same shape as the baseline). The pairs
# are derived from the environment, not from source text: the docstring-scan driver
# enumerates the persistent `nolint` attribute entries of every TauCeti module (a
# parametric attribute can only be applied in its target's defining module, so this
# is exhaustive for anything that could silence the `#lint` driver; multi-target
# `attribute [nolint foo] a b` and multi-linter `@[nolint simpComm simpNF]` forms
# yield one pair per (linter, target)). Occurrence COUNTS would fail open here:
# broadening an allowlisted `attribute [nolint foo] a` to `a b c` keeps any per-file
# count intact, but adds (foo, b) and (foo, c) pairs that are not allowlisted -> fail.
# The enumeration is calibrated per run: it must see at least one nolint entry among
# ALL imported modules (Batteries/Mathlib carry some), else it fails as blind.
# Growing the allowlist must go through the same human-reviewed path as this script —
# it is exactly the hole an auto-merged PR would otherwise use.
#
# SECURITY MODEL (this script elaborates the PR's own code — both drivers execute
# import-time initializers — so treat all lean output as partially
# attacker-controlled):
#   * The `#lint` report starts with a header line
#       -- Found N error(s) in M declarations (plus ...) in TauCeti with K linters
#     followed (when N > 0) by one section per reporting linter, opened by a line
#       /- The `<linter>` linter reports:
#     and containing one `#check <decl> /- ... -/` block per violation.
#     When N > 0 the report is an error diagnostic, so the header carries the
#     `<driver>:<line>:<col>: error: ` prefix of our own driver file (a fresh mktemp
#     path) and lean exits nonzero; when N = 0 it is an info message printed bare.
#     We require EXACTLY ONE header in the output, of the form matching the exit
#     code (anchored error header + N > 0 for a nonzero exit; bare header + N = 0
#     for a zero exit), and we require the header's "with K linters" to equal the
#     length of the `#lint only` list we requested.
#   * The report region (everything after the header) is parsed by a block-aware
#     state machine: a `#check` block runs from `^#check ` to the first line ending
#     in `-/`, and everything inside it is comment CONTENT (violation messages embed
#     attacker-chosen declaration names and types, so a message line shaped like a
#     section opener or a `#check` must not carry structure). Section openers are
#     accepted only OUTSIDE blocks, must name a linter from the expected set
#     (docBlame never runs, so a docBlame opener is forgery by construction), and no
#     section may open twice — otherwise forged content could re-attribute
#     subsequent real `#check`s to another linter, and a declaration can
#     legitimately sit under two linters in the baseline. Each block must close
#     before the next opens and must fall inside a section, and the block count must
#     equal N. Every grammar violation is a DISTINCT driver failure, never a pass.
#   * PR code can print arbitrary text at import time (initializers): a forged header
#     printed alongside the real one yields two headers -> fail, and a forged smaller
#     report cannot suppress the real report's `error:` diagnostic or lean's nonzero
#     exit. Forged `#check` lines make the block count disagree with N -> fail.
#   * The docstring scan prints one `DOCSCAN <decl> ...` line per violation, one
#     `DOCSCAN-ALL <decl> <status>` line per scanned declaration, one
#     `NOLINT <linter> <decl>` line per TauCeti `@[nolint]` application, and (in
#     changed-module mode) one `LINTENV-DECL <decl>` line per selected declaration.
#     Exactly one summary line ends in a per-run random nonce marker and carries its
#     own counts for ALL of these. We require exit 0, EXACTLY ONE summary line, every
#     count to match its line tally, the global calibration guards above (sentinels,
#     baseline coverage, scanned floor, at least one visible docstring), and the
#     nolint pairs to be allowlisted. Forged DOCSCAN/DOCSCAN-ALL/NOLINT/LINTENV-DECL
#     lines break the tallies (they can only ADD lines — the real ones still print);
#     a forged summary must predict the nonce.
#   * The remaining forgery needs a process to die before the real work runs while
#     having already printed a single self-consistent PASSING report. Commands after
#     a failed command still elaborate, so the `#lint` driver appends a `#eval`
#     printing a per-run random nonce after the `#lint`, and we require that marker
#     AFTER the header; the scan's nonce-carrying summary plays the same role there.
#   * Residual risk (accepted): initializer code could read /proc/self/cmdline to
#     learn the driver path AND read the driver file to learn the nonce, then forge a
#     passing report and exit(0) before the real work. Any lint that elaborates
#     untrusted code has this ceiling; the pr-build landrun sandbox plus human review
#     of suspicious `initialize`/`@[init]` code are the outer defense. Everything
#     short of that deliberate two-step forgery fails closed.
#
# Run from the repo root (or anywhere; it cd's to the root) AFTER `lake build` — it
# needs the compiled oleans. It does no network I/O and writes only under $TMPDIR, so
# it is safe inside the pr-build landrun sandbox. Usage:
#
#   scripts/lint-env.sh                              # repository-wide CI check
#   scripts/lint-env.sh --changed-since-merge-base <revision>  # changed-module authoring check
#   scripts/lint-env.sh --update                     # rewrite the global baseline
#
# The changed-module form imports only existing added, copied, modified, renamed, or
# untracked `TauCeti/**/*.lean` modules and reports only declarations defined in those
# modules. CI deliberately uses the no-argument, repository-wide form.

# docBlame opener, like any other unexpected name, is structural forgery), and each
